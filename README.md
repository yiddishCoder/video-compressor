**Video Compressor** is a minimal, no-nonsense desktop app for compressing and converting your video files.  
It's designed to do one thingâ€”make your videos smaller and more shareableâ€”without any clutter or confusion.

## What does it do?

- **Compresses and converts videos** (MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, and more) to smaller, more manageable files.
- **Quality control** with CRF (Constant Rate Factor) settings from 18-28 for fine-tuned compression.
- **Encoding presets** from ultrafast to veryslow for speed/quality trade-offs.
- Lets you pick a video, choose quality settings, and save the resultâ€”**that's it**.
- **Output is always MP4** (the most common format), to keep things simple and compatible for everyone.
- No ads, no signups, no unnecessary features.  
- Just a clean, simple interface for a single purpose.

## How was it built?

This app was coded almost entirely with the help of AI (yes, really!).  
If you find a bug, blame the robots, not the human. ðŸ˜‰
